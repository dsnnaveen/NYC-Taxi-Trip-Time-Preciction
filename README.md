# NYC-Taxi-Trip-Time-Preciction
In New York City many of people commute to different regions of city via taxi. A lot of streets and roads in New York city are quite busy due to traffic jams, construction or road blockage etc. Therefore, It is very important to predict the trip duration of taxi so that the user will know how much time it will take to commute from one place to other. Also, due to the increasing popularity of app-based taxi such as ola or uber and there competitive pricing levels. Decisions has to be taken by the user for opting which one to choose based on trip pricing and duration. This prediction also helps drivers to choose route having lesser trip time. We were provided with dataset which is released by NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission. This dataset contains pickup time, drop-off time, geo- coordinates, number of passengers, trip duration and several other variables Our primary motivesare to analyzed the dataset, perform feature engineering to comes up with suitable independent features and building a good modelthat will help us in predicting the trip duration of NYC taxi. Here, for prediction the taxi trip duration we have applied a linear regression, lasso and ridge regression and then we have applied XGBoost and LightGBM. To find out which will give better acuracy and with lesser amount of prediction time. At last, a comparison of the two mentioned algorithms facilitates us to decide that XGBoost is more fitter and efficient than Multi-Layer Perceptron for taxi trip duration-based predictions.

The dataset is based on the 2016 NYC Yellow Cab trip record data made available in Big Query on Google Cloud Platform. The data was originally published by the NYC Taxi and Limousine commission (TLC).

The main objective is to build a predictive model, which could help them in predicting the trip duration of taxi. This would in turn help them in matching the right cabs with the right customers quickly and efficiently.
